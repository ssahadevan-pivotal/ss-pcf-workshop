## Getting started

**Prerequisites**

Start by downloading and installing the appropriate prerequisite tools.
- [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://goo.gl/M0pH4i) to interact with a cloud foundry instance
- [Apache Maven](http://info.pivotal.io/HI002010A6ZlRJR1NeU00eC) to build labs using Maven
- [Gradle](https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-3.1-all.zip) to build labs using Gradle
- [Git Client](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to clone Github repo or download and unzip
- An IDE, like [Spring Tool Suite](https://spring.io/tools/sts/all) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
- [Java SE Development Kit](http://info.pivotal.io/n0I60i3021AN0JU0le10CRR)

**Download materials**

Next, download the course materials.  This can be accomplished either through the GitHub website by downloading a repository zip and unzipping locally, or if you have Git installed, use the following commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/cbusch-pivotal/pivotal-perficient-stl-workshop
$ cd pivotal-perficient-stl-workshop/
```

**PCF Environments**

Finally, in order to perform the labs, you must be connected or logged into a live PCF environment. Initially you were asked to create a Pivotal Web Services (PWS) account for use in labs and afterwards. Two other environments have also been made available for use. Please see the [Pivotal Cloud Foundry Environment document](common/env_info.md) for details. You should have been assigned a student number and PCF instance at registration. Otherwise the instructors will provide that information for your use.
