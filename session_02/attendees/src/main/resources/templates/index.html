				<h1>Welcome to the Cloud Foundry Basic Demo!</h1>
		</div>

		<div class="row ">
		
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<p>The purpose of this application is to demonstrate some basic
					capabilities of the Pivotal Cloud Foundry Platform, in particular
					the Pivotal Elastic Runtime Service which is the core component
					responsible for running the application workloads as containers.</p>
				<h3>Application Components and Architecture</h3>
				<p>Currently the application is one deployment with the UI and
					backend packaged inside the same artifact - Spring Boot jar.
					However, logically the UI/client is completely separate from the
					backend services.</p>

				<h3>How to use this Application</h3>
				<p>
					Each menu item above links to a page that helps demonstrate a set
					of capabilities. The last item, Spring Boot, highlights the Spring
					Framework project that helps build production ready cloud
					applications and microservices in minutes. Spring Boot is not the
					focus on this demo. <a
						href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/" target="_blank">Learn
						more.</a>
				</p>
				<p>Each page has the same layout with the Accordion control and
					3 groups:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><b>Application Environment Information</b> - This provides
						information about the application environment when running inside
						PCF. You can see the Application Name, Container and Services
						information. This is useful to show things like load balancing,
						self healing, service binding among other things.</li>
					<li><b>Description</b> - We provide information on the current
						page and additional resources.</li>
					<li><b>Demonstration</b> - We list the things that can be
						demonstrated in the particular page.</li>
				</ol>
