# Pivotal Cloud Foundry - Pivotal Application Service (PAS) Base Demo
Base application to demonstrate PCF PAS

## Credits and contributions
As you all know, we often transform other work into our own. This is all based from Andrew Ripka's [cf-workshop-spring-boot github repo](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-workshop/cf-workshop-spring-boot) with some basic modifications.

## Introduction
This base application is intended to demonstrate some of the basic functionality of PCF ERS:

* PCF api, target, login, and push
* PCF environment variables
  * Spring Cloud Profiles
* Scaling, self-healing, router and load balancing
* RDBMS service and application auto-configuration
* Blue green deployments

## Getting Started now

**Prerequisites**
- [Cloud Foundry CLI](http://info.pivotal.io/p0R00I0eYJ011dAUCN06lR2)
- [Git Client](http://info.pivotal.io/i1RI0AUe6gN00C010l12J0R)
- An IDE, like [Spring Tool Suite](http://info.pivotal.io/f00RC0N0lh01eU21IAJ260R)
- [Java SE Development Kit](http://info.pivotal.io/n0I60i3021AN0JU0le10CRR)

## Building
**For simple `cf push` to cloud foundry:**
```
$ git clone [REPO]
$ cd [REPO]
$ ./mvnw -Pws -DskipTests=true clean install
```

**When included in a CI/CD pipeline:**
```
$ git clone [REPO]
$ cd [REPO]
$ ./mvnw -Pci -DskipTests=true clean install
```
## Running the application
**To run the application locally**

The application is set to use an embedded H2 database in non-PaaS environments, and to take advantage of Pivotal CF's auto-configuration for services. To use a MySQL Dev service in PCF, simply create and bind a service to the app and restart the app. No additional configuration is necessary when running locally or in Pivotal CF.

In Pivotal CF, it is assumed that a Pivotal MySQL service will be used.

```
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Then go to the http://localhost:8080 in your browser

**Running on Cloud Foundry**

Take a look at the manifest file for the recommended setting. Adjust them as per your environment.

The application tries to be self-descriptive. You'll see when you access the application.
